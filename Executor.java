		// 1. Initialize one ArrayQueue per oracle (arrays will work best).

		// 2. Put the questions into the queues, assigning each one to the queue of the oracle whose number is returned by the random number generator.

		// 3. Loop through the oracles, having each one remove a question from its queue (if empty do nothing) and answer it with its unique answer (oracle[k] uses answers[k]). Do this repeatedly till all queues become empty.
